Extend the Hand interface you implemented in the previous homework with an interface named newHand whose implementation involves a bespoke (home built) iterator. SpeciÙè∞Ñcally, newHand extends Hand by adding or overriding:
1. Boolean hasCard(Card cardToFind) // overriding the existing method
2. int occurrencesInHand(Card cardToFind) // New!
3. int occurencesInHand(Rank rankToFind) // New!
