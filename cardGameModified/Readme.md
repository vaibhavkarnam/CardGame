Design Patterns implementation

create a version where all games are created so that it is easy to create specialized types of games (decks or hands) and to perform additional operations when either is being created. Your solu- tion should make it easy to vary between di􏰃erent specialized creation options. For example, you should be able to build a 􏰄ve-card hand from a euchre deck, a pinochle deck, or a standard deck easily and directly.
