Games based on decks of cards are popular. The 􏰀base􏰁 card deck is typically 52 cards built from four categories called suits. In the USA at least, the suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades and are usually presented by symbols: p, o, n, and, m, for clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades respectively.1 Suits may have colors, either red or black. Each suit contains cards, and each card within a suit has a unique rank, typically the numbers two through ten and face cards: jack, queen, king and ace.2 Thus, the card 2p is a club whose rank is two. Often, a card has a name, which is simply its rank and suit, e.g. 2p, as a convenience. In most games, the rank is used to order cards


Technically, rank may also be called pips. A pip is a mark on a card. Traditionally, cards will have the rank expressed as a string (e.g. 2, 3,. . . , 10, J, Q, K, or A) along with a number of pips equal to the value of the card (2, 3,. . . , 10). However, face cards do not have pips so the corresponding pip count would be zero.
A deck of cards is an ordered set of cards. A standard deck is built from the cards {2, 3. . . , 10, jack, queen, king, ace} from each suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades), which means a standard deck has 52 cards. However, there are other types of decks as well:
1. A Euchre deck, which is composed of 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A of the four suits 􏰂 24 cards in total.
2. A pinochle deck, which is composed 9, 10, J, Q, K, and A of the four suits, but there are two copies of each suit. There are 48 cards in total.
3. A Vegas blackjack deck. It's composed of two or more standard decks. Typically it's six to eight decks.
Decks may be shu􏰇ed, meaning the cards within the deck are randomly ordered, or decks may be sorted. Sometimes, a deck may be cut, meaning a point in the deck is selected and 􏰄rst half of the deck {card1. . . cardselected-1} is placed at the end of the deck in order. That is, the 􏰄rst card in the deck is now cardselected; the 􏰄rst card after the original end card is now card1. Card2 follows card1 and so forth up to cardselected-1.

A game involves a deck and some number of hands. Cards are usually dealt, which means cards end up in hands. After that, the game proceeds according to whatever rules apply
